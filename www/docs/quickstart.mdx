# Quick Start

**For devs who want to ship fast.** Get your MF2 app running in 5 minutes with the stack AI moves fast with.

### Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node.js 18+" icon="node">
    MF2 requires Node.js version 18 or higher
  </Card>
  <Card title="Package manager" icon="box">
    npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun installed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 1: Run the installer (30 seconds)

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx create-mf2-app@latest my-app
```

```bash yarn
yarn create mf2-app my-app
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm create mf2-app@latest my-app
```

```bash bun
bunx create-mf2-app@latest my-app
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: Add your project name instead of `my-app`. The installer uses the command from the website: `npx create-mf2-app@latest ultrathink`
</Tip>

### Step 2: Choose your template

The CLI will ask you to choose between two production-ready templates:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="window" title="Landing Page">
    Perfect for marketing sites, portfolios, and simple web apps.
    
    **Includes:**
    - Beautiful landing page components
    - Pricing section with tiers
    - FAQ section
    - Contact forms
    - SEO optimized
    - Dark mode support
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="SaaS Starter">
    Full-stack SaaS application with everything configured.
    
    **Includes everything from Landing Page plus:**
    - User authentication (Clerk)
    - Subscription payments (Polar)
    - Real-time database (Convex)
    - Transactional emails (Resend)
    - User dashboard
    - Admin panel
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Start developing

Navigate to your project and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

<Tip>
  If you chose the SaaS template, you'll also need to run `npx convex dev` in a separate terminal for the backend.
</Tip>

Your app is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 🎉

## What's next?

### Configure your environment

If you chose the SaaS template, you'll need to set up your environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your API keys for:
   - Clerk (authentication)
   - Convex (database)
   - Polar (payments)
   - Resend (emails)

<Note>
  Don't have API keys yet? Check our [environment variables guide](/deployment/environment-variables) for step-by-step instructions.
