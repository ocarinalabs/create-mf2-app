MF2 is the boilerplate template optimized for building with AI. It's a complete, production-ready stack that includes all the popular technologies you need, pre-configured to work with AI coding tools in mind.

## What's included?

One command gives you everything:

```bash
npx create-mf2-app@latest
```

- **Next.js 15** - The framework AI knows best
- **TypeScript** - Type safety that AI can leverage
- **Tailwind + shadcn/ui** - Components AI can generate instantly
- **Convex** - Real-time database with AI-friendly APIs
- **Clerk** - Auth that just works
- **Polar** - Payments in minutes, not days
- **Resend** - Transactional emails sorted
- **AI Prompts** - Pre-written prompts for common features
- **Best practices** - Baked in from day one



## Who is MF2 for?

### Founders

Racing against runway. Skip the setup. Start validating.

Most founders waste months building products nobody wants. Winners ship a landing page in a day, add a Stripe button, and test demand. No signups in a week? Kill it. Start over. 

MF2 gives you the full stack ready. Ship your landing page today. Add payments. Market for a week. Got traction? Build the real thing next weekend. No traction? New idea, new landing page tomorrow.

Startups are a numbers game. Launch more. Launch faster. That's how you find the one that works.

### Hackathons

48 hours to build something cool.

Hackathons are about energy. Building fast. Shipping wild ideas. Making something people remember.

MF2 gets you there. No setup time wasted on auth flows or payment integrations. Everything works so you can focus on the crazy features that make people go "holy shit, how did you build that?"


The boring infrastructure is handled. Real-time sync for collaborative features. Payments if you want to charge for premium AI tokens. Auth so people can save their progress. All production-ready from minute one.

Ship it live. Get a real domain. Share it on Twitter. Let the judges use the actual product, not just watch a demo. That's the vibe.

### Side Projects

Building on nights and weekends. Every hour counts.

The graveyard of side projects is full of half-finished auth systems. Projects that died in the setup phase. Ideas that never saw the light of day because you got bored configuring Stripe webhooks.

MF2 changes that math. Your idea goes live tonight, not next month. Test it with real users. Charge real money. See if it has legs before you invest your weekends.

Build an AI agent that trades memecoins. A multiplayer game with real money stakes. An app that turns your selfies into generative art. Whatever insane idea you have at 3am.

Most side projects die. But with MF2, they at least die after you've tested them with real users, not while you're reading auth documentation.

### Agencies & Freelancers

Clients want results yesterday. They don't care about your tech stack.

Every client project starts the same way. 

"Can you build us something like [insert billion dollar startup]?" 

"When can we launch?" 

"How much?"

With MF2, the answer changes. Yes, you can build it. You can launch next week. And it costs less because you're not billing 40 hours for auth setup.

Ship MVPs in days, not months. Use patterns any developer can understand. Hand off projects that actually work. Move on to the next client while your competitors are still setting up their development environment.

The tech stack sells itself when the demo is already live.

### AI Developers

Building with AI. Building for AI. Either way, you need to ship fast.

You're using Cursor, Claude Code, or Copilot. You speak in prompts. You think in features, not boilerplate. But somehow you're still debugging OAuth flows at 2am.

MF2 is built for how you build. Standard patterns that AI understands. Clean code that LLMs can extend without hallucinating. Infrastructure that just works so you can focus on the AI magic.

Ship that ChatGPT wrapper today. Launch the AI SaaS this weekend. Build the agent swarm you've been thinking about. The boring parts are done.

AI moves fast. Your stack should too.

## The Philosophy

Build anything with AI. Ship it today.

In the AI era, the distance between idea and product has collapsed. You can build in hours what used to take months. But only if your stack keeps up.

MF2 is built for this reality. Where AI writes the code and you ship the product. Where the best idea wins, not the best infrastructure setup.

Stop reading docs. Start shipping products.
