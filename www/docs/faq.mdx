## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why Next.js 15 instead of [other framework]?" icon="react">
    **Because it's what everyone uses.** 
    
    - Most popular React framework = most AI training data
    - App Router is the future (and present)
    - Built-in optimizations that just work
    - Vercel deployment is literally one click
    - Server Components save you from complexity
    
    If you want to use Remix, Astro, or SvelteKit - cool. But you'll be configuring instead of shipping.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use PostgreSQL instead of Convex?" icon="database">
    **Yes, but why?**
    
    Convex gives you:
    - Real-time subscriptions out of the box
    - Type-safe queries without ORMs
    - Zero configuration
    - Automatic scaling
    
    If you really need PostgreSQL, check our [migration guide](/recipes/migrate-to-postgres). But try Convex first. You'll ship 10x faster.
