The `apps/storybook` directory runs [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a frontend workshop for the design system.

## Overview

Storybook ships pre-configured with every [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component, the correct fonts, and matching providers so it renders the same as your app.

```bash
turbo dev --filter=storybook
```

The preview opens at [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

## Adding stories

Create `.stories.tsx` files in `apps/storybook/stories`. Each component gets its own file:

```tsx title="apps/storybook/stories/button.stories.tsx"
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";
import { Button } from "@repo/design-system/components/ui/button";

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  title: "Components/Button",
  component: Button,
};

export default meta;

export const Default: StoryObj<typeof Button> = {
  args: { children: "Click me", variant: "default" },
};
```
