description: Isolated serverless functions for webhooks and cron jobs.
---

The `apps/api` directory houses webhooks, cron jobs, and external integrations behind a dedicated endpoint, separate from the main application.

## Overview

A standalone API gives non-web consumers (mobile apps, third-party services, IoT devices) their own endpoint. On Vercel, serverless functions scale independently regardless of how you split them. A separate app keeps concerns apart and routing clean.

```bash
turbo dev --filter=api
```

## Features

- **Cron jobs**: Scheduled tasks defined in `apps/api/app/cron`. Each job is a `.ts` file that exports a route handler.
- **Webhooks**: Inbound webhooks defined in `apps/api/app/webhooks`. Stripe and Clerk handlers are pre-configured.
