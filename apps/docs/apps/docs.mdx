The `apps/docs` directory contains [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com)-powered documentation. Each page is an `.mdx` file written in Markdown with built-in UI components.

## Overview

Mintlify turns MDX files into a documentation site with search, syntax highlighting, and interactive components. All configuration lives in `docs.json`.

```bash
turbo dev --filter=docs
```

Or directly with the Mint CLI:

```bash
mint dev --port 3004
```

## Creating a page

Add an MDX file to `apps/docs`. The file name becomes the URL slug:

```mdx title="apps/docs/hello-world.mdx"
---
title: 'Hello World'
description: 'A new documentation page.'
---
```

Learn more about supported [page metadata](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/pages).

## Adding a page to the navigation

Add it to `docs.json`:

```json title="docs.json"
"navigation": {
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "pages": ["hello-world"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

Customize global settings, themes, and components through `docs.json`. See Mintlify's docs on [settings](https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings) and [components](https://mintlify.com/docs/components).
