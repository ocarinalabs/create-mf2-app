The `apps/app` directory contains the core SaaS application built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It wires together authentication, real-time data, AI chat, billing, and collaboration.

## Overview

The primary application your users interact with. It splits into authenticated and unauthenticated route groups, so public pages and protected dashboards coexist in the same codebase.

```bash
turbo dev --filter=app
```

## Features

- **[Design System](/packages/design-system)**: shadcn/ui components, hooks, and utilities.
- **[Authentication](/packages/auth)**: Clerk login, sign-up, organizations, and route protection. Email login included; extend it for other providers.
