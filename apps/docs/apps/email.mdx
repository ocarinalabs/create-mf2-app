description: Email templates built with React Email.
---

The `apps/email` directory contains [React Email](https://react.email/) templates and a preview server for viewing them in the browser.

## Overview

Build transactional emails with React components and TypeScript. The preview server renders templates live as you edit.

```bash
turbo dev --filter=email
```

## Creating a template

Add a `.tsx` file in `apps/email/templates/`. Export a default React component. Set default props to provide preview data in the dev server.

## Sending emails

Send templates through `@repo/email`, which wraps [Resend](https://resend.com):

```ts title="apps/app/actions/welcome.ts"
import { sendEmail } from "@repo/email";
import Welcome from "@repo/email/templates/welcome";

await sendEmail({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Welcome aboard",
  react: Welcome({ name: "Jane" }),
});
```

Set `RESEND_TOKEN` in your [environment variables](/setup/env) to enable delivery.
