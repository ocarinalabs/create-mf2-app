title: Transactional Emails
description: Transactional email via Resend.
---

`@repo/email` sends transactional email (verification, password resets, receipts) through [Resend](https://resend.com/docs). Templates live in `apps/email/` as React Email components.

## Usage

Send an email from any server context:

```ts title="apps/api/routes/invite.ts"
import { sendEmail } from "@repo/email";

await sendEmail({
  to: email,
  subject: `You've been invited to ${teamName}`,
  template: "team-invitation",
  props: { teamName, inviteUrl },
});
```

## Templates

Templates are React components in `apps/email/`:

```tsx title="apps/email/emails/welcome.tsx"
import { Html, Head, Body, Text } from "@react-email/components";

export default function WelcomeEmail({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Body>
        <Text>Welcome, {name}! Your account is ready.</Text>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

Preview templates locally: `bun run dev --filter=email`.
