description: Scheduled tasks powered by Convex.

Convex runs cron jobs as serverless functions on a schedule. Define them in `packages/backend/convex/crons.ts`.

```ts title="packages/backend/convex/crons.ts"
import { cronJobs } from "convex/server";
import { internal } from "./_generated/api";

const crons = cronJobs();

crons.interval("clean up expired sessions", { hours: 24 }, internal.auth.cleanup, {});

export default crons;
```

Jobs run automatically in both development and production. Monitor them in the Convex dashboard under **Cron Jobs**.

See [Convex cron docs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs).
