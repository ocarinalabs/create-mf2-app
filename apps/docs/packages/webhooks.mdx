description: Outbound webhook delivery with Svix.
---

`@repo/webhooks` sends outbound webhooks to external services through [Svix](https://docs.svix.com). Svix handles retries, exponential backoff, and signature verification.

This package handles outbound webhooks (your app notifying others). The backend package handles inbound webhooks (Clerk, Stripe) in `convex/http.ts`.

## Usage

Send a webhook when an event occurs:

```ts title="apps/api/routes/projects.ts"
import { sendWebhook } from "@repo/webhooks";

await sendWebhook({
  eventType: "project.created",
  payload: {
    id: project.id,
    name: project.name,
    createdAt: project.createdAt,
  },
});
```

## Webhook Portal

Give customers a self-service UI to manage their endpoints:

```ts title="apps/api/routes/webhook-portal.ts"
import { getPortalUrl } from "@repo/webhooks";

const portalUrl = await getPortalUrl({ appId: userId });
return Response.json({ url: portalUrl });
```
