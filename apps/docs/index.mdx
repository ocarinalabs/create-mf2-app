description: A SaaS monorepo built with Next.js, Convex, and Bun.
---

**mf²** (Move Fawking Fast) is an opinionated Turborepo template for Next.js apps, built for the agent era. Auth, payments, email, analytics, and deployment ship pre-configured. Based on [next-forge](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/next-forge), adapted with Convex as the backend and Bun as the runtime.

```bash
bunx create-mf2-app
```

The monorepo splits into **apps** (six deployable applications) and **packages** (shared libraries). Every integration is type-safe, and every tool stores its configuration in code, not dashboards.

Read [Why This Stack?](/philosophy) for the full reasoning behind each choice.
