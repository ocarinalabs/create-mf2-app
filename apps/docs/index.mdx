description: The startup-in-a-command monorepo built for the agent era.
---

**mf²** (Move Fawking Fast) is an opinionated Turborepo monorepo designed for AI-assisted development. Auth, payments, email, analytics, and deployment ship pre-configured. Every tool stores its configuration in typed code, not dashboards. Agents like Claude Code and Cursor read the source, write the code, and let the type checker verify it.

```bash
bunx create-mf2-app
```

The monorepo splits into **apps** (six deployable applications) and **packages** (shared libraries that wrap one concern each). Agents navigate the codebase the same way you do: follow the types, read the package, make the change. The type checker catches mistakes before anything ships.

## Built for agents

mf² treats AI agents as first-class contributors. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and [agent skills](/skills) ship pre-configured. [Colocation](/colocation) keeps related files together so agents find what they need immediately. [Typed packages](/structure) give agents clear boundaries and fast feedback from the compiler.

Read [Why This Stack?](/philosophy) for the reasoning behind each choice.

## Where this is headed

mf² is becoming a startup-in-a-command. The web stack ships today. Mobile apps, desktop apps, and browser extensions are next. See the [roadmap](/roadmap).
