description: Pre-installed AI agent skills that ship with mf².
---

mf² ships with agent skills in `.claude/skills/` that teach AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) how to work with the stack. Each skill gives the agent procedural knowledge for specific tools and patterns, so it writes correct code without guessing.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a folder in `.claude/skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` file. The markdown defines when the skill activates, what it knows, and how it behaves. Some skills include `references/` or `rules/` subdirectories with deeper guidance.

Agents read these files when they match a task. For example, when you ask an agent to "add Clerk auth to a page," the `clerk-nextjs-patterns` skill provides the correct server vs client patterns without the agent needing to search documentation.

Skills work across Claude Code, Cursor (via `.cursor/rules/`), GitHub Copilot, and other agents that support the format.
