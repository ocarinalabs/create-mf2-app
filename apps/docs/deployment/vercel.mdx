description: How to deploy your mf² apps to Vercel.

Each app in the monorepo deploys as a separate Vercel project.

## Steps

1. Push your monorepo to GitHub.
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new). Create one Vercel project per app.
3. Set the root directory for each project:

| Vercel Project | Root Directory |
|---------------|----------------|
| Main application | `apps/app` |
| Marketing website | `apps/web` |
| API layer | `apps/api` |

4. Add environment variables from your `.env` file to each project:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | Production Convex deployment URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk publishable key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk server-side secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Production URL for the main app |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` | Production URL for the marketing site |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` | Production URL for the docs |

5. Deploy. Pushes to `main` trigger automatic deployments.

## Vercel Integrations

The [Clerk integration](https://vercel.com/integrations) and [Convex integration](https://vercel.com/integrations) auto-sync their keys to your Vercel projects.

## Documentation

The `apps/docs/` site deploys via [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com), not Vercel. Configure your docs domain in the Mintlify dashboard.

## Monorepo Behavior

Vercel detects Turborepo and scopes builds to the affected app. Only changed apps rebuild. Each Vercel project keeps its own environment variables; they are not shared across projects.
