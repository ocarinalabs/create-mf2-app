description: Where to register and manage your domains.
---

You need at least one domain for your production deployment. Most mf² setups use subdomains for each app:

| App | Subdomain |
|-----|-----------|
| Main application | `app.yourdomain.com` |
| Marketing website | `www.yourdomain.com` |
| API | `api.yourdomain.com` |
| Documentation | `docs.yourdomain.com` |

## Recommended Registrars

### Vercel Domains

Buy and manage domains directly from your Vercel dashboard. Domains connect to your projects without configuration: no DNS records to set, no SSL certificates to manage.

Best for teams already deploying on Vercel who want the simplest setup.

### Porkbun

Low prices, free WHOIS privacy, and a clean dashboard. Porkbun consistently offers the cheapest renewal rates among reputable registrars. Connect to Vercel by pointing nameservers or adding DNS records.

### Cloudflare Registrar

Domains at wholesale cost with no markup. Cloudflare charges exactly what the registry charges. You also get their DNS, DDoS protection, and CDN. Connect to Vercel through DNS records.

## Which to Pick

| Registrar | Best For | Pricing |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Vercel | Zero-config setup, everything in one dashboard | Standard |
| Porkbun | Cheapest renewals, good for multiple domains | Low |
| Cloudflare | At-cost pricing, DDoS protection, CDN | Wholesale |

If you want the fastest path from purchase to production, buy through Vercel. If you want the lowest price and don't mind configuring DNS, use Porkbun or Cloudflare.

## Connecting to Vercel

If you bought your domain outside of Vercel, add it in your Vercel project settings under **Domains**. Vercel provides the DNS records you need to add at your registrar. Vercel provisions SSL certificates automatically.

For Mintlify docs, configure your docs subdomain in the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) separately.
