description: Modular backend building blocks from the Convex ecosystem.

[Convex Components](https://www.convex.dev/components) are independent, sandboxed TypeScript modules that add features to your Convex backend. Each component manages its own tables, functions, and state. Install with npm, register in `convex.config.ts`, and start using.

## Pre-installed

mf² ships with five components already registered:

| Component | Package | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [Stripe](/packages/payments) | `@convex-dev/stripe` | Checkout sessions, subscriptions, customer management, webhook sync |
| [Resend](/packages/email) | `@convex-dev/resend` | Transactional email delivery with event tracking |
| [Workflow](https://github.com/get-convex/workflow) | `@convex-dev/workflow` | Durable, long-running code flows with retries and delays |
| [Action Retrier](https://github.com/get-convex/action-retrier) | `@convex-dev/action-retrier` | Automatic retry with backoff for unreliable external calls |
| [Migrations](https://github.com/get-convex/migrations) | `@convex-dev/migrations` | Schema migrations for live data without downtime |

Register them in `packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts`:

```ts title="packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts"
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import actionRetrier from "@convex-dev/action-retrier/convex.config.js";
import migrations from "@convex-dev/migrations/convex.config.js";
import resend from "@convex-dev/resend/convex.config.js";
import stripe from "@convex-dev/stripe/convex.config.js";
import workflow from "@convex-dev/workflow/convex.config.js";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(actionRetrier);
app.use(migrations);
app.use(resend);
app.use(stripe);
app.use(workflow);

export default app;
```

## Adding a component

Install the package and register it:

```bash
bun add @convex-dev/rate-limiter
```

```ts title="packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts"
import rateLimiter from "@convex-dev/rate-limiter/convex.config.js";

app.use(rateLimiter);
```

Then use it in your Convex functions via the generated `components` object:

```ts title="packages/backend/convex/example.ts"
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
```

Each component sandboxes its own tables. They don't mix with your app tables and can only interact through explicitly defined APIs.
