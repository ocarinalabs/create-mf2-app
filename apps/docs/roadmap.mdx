description: Where mf² is headed.
---

mf² ships a complete web stack today. The goal is a startup-in-a-command: every platform a product needs, in one monorepo, with AI agents building across all of them.

## The vision

Most startups need more than a web app. They need a mobile app, a desktop client, a browser extension, docs, email, and a marketing site. Today each lives in a separate repo with separate tooling. Every AI agent must learn a different codebase for every platform.

mf² puts everything in one monorepo with shared packages. An agent that understands `@repo/auth` in the web app understands it in the mobile app, the desktop client, and the extension. Same types, same patterns, one context.

## Coming soon

### Mobile: React Native + Expo

An `apps/mobile` workspace using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native. It consumes the same `@repo/auth`, `@repo/analytics`, `@repo/design-system` (via [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)), and `@repo/backend` packages. One Convex backend serves both web and mobile. An agent writes a feature once; it runs on both platforms.

### Desktop: Electron

An `apps/desktop` workspace using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). The desktop app runs the same React frontend from the monorepo in a native window. It imports from `@repo/auth`, `@repo/design-system`, and `@repo/backend` directly. No separate codebase, no second set of conventions for the agent to learn.

### Browser extension: Plasmo

An `apps/extension` workspace using [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com) for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari extensions. Plasmo handles manifest generation, content scripts, and hot reload. The extension imports from `@repo/auth` and `@repo/design-system` like any other app in the monorepo.

## The stack is opinionated

Every tool in mf² earns its place. One solution per problem, configured fully. AI agents write better code when the stack is predictable. Fewer choices mean fewer mistakes.

The same principle applies to new platforms. One mobile framework, one desktop toolkit, one extension framework, all wired into the same monorepo with the same conventions.
